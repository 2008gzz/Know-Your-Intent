# IntentClassificationUsingSemanticHashing

Intent Classification using Semantic Hashing as Featurizer. This was done during a Hack Night at Lulea in Prof. Marcus Liwicki lab.  We successfully achieved State-of-the-Art results in three datasets: 
1. Ask Ubuntu Coprus
2. Web Application Corpus
3. Chatbot Corpus

The results were compared with other Chatbot provider services like Google DialogueFlow, Facebook Wit AI, IBM Watson, Recast AI, Botify and so on. 

The README will be updated soon with results and benchmarks.
