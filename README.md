# Know your Intent : Intent Classification Using Semantic Hashing

Intent Classification using Semantic Hashing as Featurizer. We successfully achieved State-of-the-Art results in three datasets: 
1. Ask Ubuntu Coprus
2. Web Application Corpus
3. Chatbot Corpus

Read about the method used in more details [here](https://medium.com/@shridhar743/know-your-intent-sota-results-in-intent-classification-8e1ca47f364c)

The results were compared with other Chatbot provider services like Google DialogueFlow, Facebook Wit AI, IBM Watson, Recast AI, Botify and so on and this is how the results look :
